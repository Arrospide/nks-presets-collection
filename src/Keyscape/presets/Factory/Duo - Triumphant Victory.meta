  "comment": "TIP - Adjust the Reverb under EFFECTS.\n\nThis majestic and cinematic Duo was created by combining a custom-modified, 7' 6\" Yamaha C7 Grand Piano with a hand-crafted Clavichord - an instrument first used in the 1400s. Lower Octaves are mixed in to add body. Useful for a unique melodic color in any genre and terrific for scoring.",
