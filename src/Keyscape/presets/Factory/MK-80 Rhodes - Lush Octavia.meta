  "comment": "TIP - Try the different Models under MAIN.\n\nHISTORY - Roland bought the Rhodes brand name in 1987 and in 1989, they released the MK-80 - a digital recreation of the electro-mechanical Rhodes. Because of the reverence which die-hard Rhodes fans have for the original instruments and the brand itself, this short-lived keyboard has long been scorned as a digital \"wannabe\" instrument. \n\nWhat's less known is that the technology used in the MK-80 was actually the next generation of Structured Adaptive Synthesis pioneered in the legendary MKS-20 and its digital Rhodes sounds are excellent in their own way. They layer quite well with other Electric Piano sounds.",
