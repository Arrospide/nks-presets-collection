  "comment": "TIP - Control the \"Wash\" with the Reverb controls under EFFECTS.\n\nMade by combining a custom-modified, 7' 6\" Yamaha C7 Grand Piano with a pristine early '70s 73-key MkI Suitcase. This often-used layering is bathed in REVERB for a spacey, moody vibe. Perfect for scoring or ballads.",
