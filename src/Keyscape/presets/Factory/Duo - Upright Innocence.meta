  "comment": "TIP - Adjust the Octave controls under TONE.  \n\nThis lovely Duo is made from a combination of a rare, turn-of-the-20th-Century Wing Upright piano and an early 1900s Toy Piano. A home-by-the-hearth piano with a subtle sheen. Tons of character for scoring and it's great for Indie bands.",
