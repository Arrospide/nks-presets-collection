  "comment": "TIP - Adjust the compression and tape saturation under COMP.\n\nHISTORY - This custom-modified, 7' 6\" Yamaha C7 Grand Piano, belongs to renowned Los Angeles piano tech, Jim Wilson. It is fitted with Renner \"Blue Point\" hammers with Weickert felt - a special piano hammer felt used during the pre-Cold War \"golden age of Steinway.\" This special long-fiber virgin wool felt (which became available again after the reunification of Germany) contributes to the hammers producing a wider tonal spectrum. The tone, dynamics, and sustain of this particular instrument are astounding.\n\nWeeks went into manicuring the voicing (fine adjustment of the hammer felt density using special needles and a variety of techniques) to achieve the greatest possible dynamic range and color palette. Special care was taken to create warmth at softer velocities and more bite at higher velocities. Jim was involved with our sound designers throughout the recording and gave his blessing to the finished product.",
