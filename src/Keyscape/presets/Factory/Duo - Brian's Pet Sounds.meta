  "comment": "TIP - Try adjusting the Mix controls under MAIN.\n\nReminiscent of the iconic Beach Boys album, this Duo is made from a combination of a rare, turn-of-the-20th-Century Wing Upright piano and a 1960s-era Baldwin Electric Harpsichord with the string mute engaged. Perfect for Americana and Indie bands.",
