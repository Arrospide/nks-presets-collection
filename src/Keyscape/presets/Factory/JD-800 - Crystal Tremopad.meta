  "comment": "TIP - Try different Tremolo settings under EFFECTS.\n\nHISTORY - By the 1990s, the DX-7 Rhodes sound had run its course, but keyboard players still wanted an electric piano sound that had a cleaner, glossy sheen. Roland's JD-800 patch \"Crystal Rhodes\" was the answer. Like the D-50, it used Roland's four-layer Sample + Synthesis method, but the architecture was much-improved and the sound was lush and vibrant. In fact, the JD-800's core waveforms and Factory presets were created by Eric Persing!\n\nThe JD-800 had separate microprocessors for the synth section and keyboard scanning, and its playing response was as fast as CV synths - setting it apart from the overloaded processors of its contemporaries. To the JD-800's 4 oscillators, 4 filters, 8 LFOs and 12 envelopes, Roland added ultra high-quality effects and brought back an analog-style hardware panel.",
