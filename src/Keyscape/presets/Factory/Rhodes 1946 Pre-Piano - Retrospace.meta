  "comment": "TIP - Try adjusting the Reverb under EFFECTS.\n\nHISTORY - The first instrument that Harold Rhodes ever developed was an acoustic, 2 1/2 octave keyboard called the Xylette, made with tines crafted from small aluminum tubes scavenged from the wings of a wrecked B-17 bomber. It was made in 1942 to aid in the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers in WW II. After the war, Rhodes came up with a self-amplified version for students. The mostly hand-built \"Pre-Piano\" was an instant success and his new Rhodes Piano Co. sold hundreds to the Los Angeles School District's music program. Only a few of these hand-built instruments survive today. \n\nIts grandfather clock-like tines were amplified with a piezo pickup routed to a small tube amp and speaker. It was the only Rhodes instrument ever equipped with self-amplification. The Pre-Piano was made from 1946-1948 and over a decade later, he created the Piano Bass and the Rhodes Electric Piano. We recorded the direct signal and the mic-ed speakers.",
