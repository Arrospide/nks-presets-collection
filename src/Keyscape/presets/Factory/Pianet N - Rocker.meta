  "comment": "TIP - Turn up Drive under AMP for more crunch.\n\nHISTORY - Originally intended for home use, the Pianet was created by Hohner's visionary designer, Ernst Zacharias, also the inventor of the Clavinet. Pianets were in production from the early 1960s to the early 1980s. The signature sound of the Hohner Pianet N was heard in The Beatles' \"I am the Walrus, \"Summer in the City \" by The Lovin' Spoonful, and in many other hits of the 1960s.\n\nThe Pianet employs foam and leather pads which stick to the reeds. Depressing a key causes the sticky pad to pull on the reed, bending it upward and when it lets go, the reed vibrates. It uses powered pickups and a photo-sensitive amplitude circuit for the tremolo. With no sustain mechanism, the Pianet has a crisp staccato sound. The rare Pianet N is enjoying a resurgence in popularity due to the availability of replacement parts. This immaculate and pristine Pianet N is from the eclectic vintage keyboard collection of LA Session keyboardist, Zac Rae.",
