Difficult to acquire in the US, this rare \"Cold War\" electro-mechanical keyboard instrument was in production for a brief time in the late 1960s by accordion manufacturer, Weltmeister in East Germany.\n\nThe battery-powered Basset 2 was popular in the 1960s and early 1970s with East German dance bands. Its mechanical piano action was derived from its big brother, the Weltmeister Claviset. Pressing a key causes the lip of a rubber disc to pluck the tine. When the key is released, the sound is stopped by a foam damper. A warning label in German, Cyrillic Russian, and English warns of \"danger of life\" if you connect it to a radio or an amplifier with AC-DC!",
