  "comment": "TIP - Try different Character settings under MAIN.\n\nHISTORY - This Wing Upright Piano is a perfectly-maintained, century-old upright grand, with a strong, warm sound - reminiscent of the turn-of-the-20th Century. It came with four pedals instead of the usual two to activate the \"Instrumental Attachment.\" The second pedal is labeled, \"Orchestra.\" When depressed, it lowers a bar fitted with small metal rings suspended from felt strips, positioning the rings between the hammers and the strings. The hammers hit the rings, which then hit the strings, transforming it into a tack piano. We recorded this version with a single tube mic.\n\nWing and Son sold their pianos via mail order with free shipping. They guaranteed them for 40 years and offered a free, four week trial period after which, if you did not like the piano for any reason, they would come and pick it up with no questions asked! This Style 19 Wing Upright Concert Grand is from the eclectic collection of LA session keyboardist Zac Rae.",
