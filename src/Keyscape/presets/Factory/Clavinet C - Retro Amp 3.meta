Although originally designed as an electric Clavichord for '60s folk music, the Hohner Clavinet became a mainstay in '70s Funk and Rock when Stevie Wonder used a Clavinet C on his mega-hit, \"Superstition.\"\n\nThe Clavinet is an electro-mechanical keyboard, with two single coil pickups. The keys cause polymer-tipped hammers to strike the electric guitar-like strings, pushing them abruptly into contact with the -anvil,- a metal bar which serves as a fret, causing them to sound. We painstakingly recorded this famous Clavinet C using the original strings through customized pre-amps from Clavinet.com.",
