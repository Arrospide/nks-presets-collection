  "comment": "TIP - Try different Tremolo settings under MAIN.\n\nHISTORY - We are pleased to present the official virtual instrument version of the Vintage Vibe Electric Piano. Since the mid-1960s, the Rhodes Electric Piano has been heard on practically every recording in almost every style of music, but these classic instruments were discontinued in the 1980s. Fast-forward to 2011 when Vintage Vibe released their new, hand-built \"Tine Piano.\" A high-quality, modern take on a classic with a vibey, authentic sound - the first \"real\" electric piano made from scratch in decades.\n\nIt comes with American-made steel tines and rubber-tipped wooden hammers, along with either hand-wound passive pickups or Peterson-style pre-amps with stereo tremolo. The super-consistent action lets you play softly for a warm tone or lay into it for a real growl. We worked closely with Vintage Vibe to create the ultimate version of this modern-day classic!",
