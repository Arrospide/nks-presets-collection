The sound was distinctive and it looked really cool on stage! But, they were pricey and the players who could afford one got tired of lugging around that 300 lb. beast! In 1986, Roland unveiled the 16-voice MKS-20 and its Electric Grand sound quickly earned its place on stage next to its analog cousin. In the same family as the CP70, it has its own unique sonic qualities.\n\nEric Persing worked on developing the famous MKS-20 sounds in Japan with Roland in the '80s. Roland wisely combined the digital side of the instrument with high-quality analog components and effects, resulting in a far warmer sound than most keyboards of that time. The unit went on to be used on thousands of well-known productions and remains an enduring classic.",
