Originally intended for home use, the Pianet was created by Hohner's visionary designer, Ernst Zacharias, also the inventor of the Clavinet. A series of different versions were in production from the early 1960s to the early 1980s. The Pianet M was essentially the Pianet T mechanism installed in a wooden console with speakers for home use. Unlike the Pianet T, the M had a built-in effects unit, called the \"Modulator.\"\n\nThe Pianet employs foam and leather pads which stick to the reeds. Depressing a key causes the sticky pad to pull on the reed, bending it upward - when it lets go, the reed vibrates. The Pianet M used a silicone activation pad, a variety of metal composition for the reeds, and passive pickups. The Pianet M is enjoying a resurgence in popularity due to the availability of replacement parts.",
