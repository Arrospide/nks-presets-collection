  "comment": "TIP - Try the Mix and Timbre controls under MAIN.\n\nThis organic and motion-filled acoustic keyboard sound is made from a combination of a rare, turn-of-the-20th-Century Wing Upright piano, using its \"Tremolo\" attachment, and a handcrafted Clavichord. Excellent for old-timey music, Country, and scoring applications.",
