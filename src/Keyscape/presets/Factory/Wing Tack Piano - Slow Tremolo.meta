  "comment": "TIP - Use Color Shift under MAIN for interesting tonal changes.\n\nHISTORY - This Wing Upright Piano is a perfectly-maintained, century-old upright grand, with a strong, warm sound - reminiscent of the turn-of-the-20th Century. It came with four pedals instead of the usual two to activate the \"Instrumental Attachment,\" a factory option that permitted the player to (in the words of one of their print ads from 1903), \"imitate perfectly the tones of the mandolin, guitar, zither, harp, and banjo.\" This Patch combines both the tacks and the tremolo pedals. We recorded this version with stereo mics.\n\nWing and Son sold their pianos via mail order with free shipping. They guaranteed them for 40 years and offered a free, four week trial period after which, if you did not like the piano for any reason, they would come and pick it up with no questions asked! This Style 19 Wing Upright Concert Grand is from the eclectic collection of LA session keyboardist Zac Rae.",
