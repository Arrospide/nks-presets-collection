The thing is, they're big and delicate and tough to move. In 1986, Roland unveiled the MKS-20. Included with the impressive Electric Pianos was Roland's signature Vibes sound.\n\nEric Persing worked on developing the famous MKS-20 sounds in Japan with Roland in the '80s. Roland wisely combined the digital side of the instrument with high-quality analog components and effects, resulting in a far warmer sound than most keyboards of that time. The unit went on to be used on thousands of well-known productions and remains an enduring classic.",
