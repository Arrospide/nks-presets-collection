  "comment": "TIP - Try adjusting the Reverb under EFFECTS.\n\nHISTORY - With over 250,000 Fender Rhodes produced, a major culture has grown up around the instrument. Numerous models were produced between 1965 and 1984, but the consensus is that the early '70s 73-key MkI with wood keys and Peterson electronics is the ideal specimen. That classic is featured here. We recorded via the pre-amp and captured the mechanical noises with a mic.\n\nThe Rhodes piano action causes its hammers to strike a tine (a tuned metal rod) which is attached to a more substantial metal tonebar for sustain. The sound is amplified by an electro-magnetic pickup routed to an active pre-amp. Our amazing-sounding instrument was carefully restored and rebuilt by renowned Los Angeles keyboard tech, Ken Rich.",
