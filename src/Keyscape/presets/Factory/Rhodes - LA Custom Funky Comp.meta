That elusive sound that, no matter how much EQ you dialed in or spent on modifications, you could never get that same sparkle and punch? Well, we were fortunate enough to get our hands on this legendary custom 1974 Fender Rhodes (serial number 54247-044074) and took the greatest care to reproduce its gorgeous mojo. \n\nThe instrument's extraordinary sound comes from Eddy Reynolds, the legendary '80s-era LA keyboard tech who performed his wizardry on this unique electric piano - one which was often rented and used on hundreds of famous albums. The combination of Eddy's magic touch, custom pre-amp design, and this particular standout Rhodes created a sonic masterpiece that is highly versatile, and extremely rare!",
