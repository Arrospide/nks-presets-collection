Originally intended for home use, the Pianet was created by Hohner's visionary designer, Ernst Zacharias, also the inventor of the Clavinet. A series of different versions were in production from the early 1960s to the early 1980s. Made with gigging musicians in mind, the compact and portable Pianet T was the simplest of any of the electromagnetic keyboards at the time - no tremolo, no controls, not even a volume knob.\n\nThe Pianet employs foam and leather pads which stick to the reeds. Depressing a key causes the sticky pad to pull on the reed, bending it upward - when it lets go, the reed vibrates. The Pianet T used a silicone activation pad, new metal composition for the reeds, and passive pickups. It has a mellower sound than its predecessors. The Pianet T is enjoying a resurgence in popularity due to the availability of replacement parts.",
