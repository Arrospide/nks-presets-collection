  "comment": "TIP - Try adjusting the Reverb under EFFECTS.\n\nHISTORY - In the 1930s, the Wurlitzer Piano & Organ Company created the space-saving \"Butterfly\" baby grand piano series for smaller homes and apartments. They came in 73 and 88-key models, as well as the 44-key \"Student\" Miniature Grand. Called \"Butterfly\" because the lid was divided into two \"wings\" which could be opened for more volume, the \"Student Grand\" had a cast iron harp, real piano strings (only 2 per note, instead of three), and a real piano action and soundboard. \n\nMarketed as a child's first piano, they worked and sounded fine, but were more of a novelty than a workhorse practice piano, as little literature is written for its limited range. Weighing 100 lbs and standing 30\" tall, few of these gems are still in existence. Sought after by musicians and collectors alike - for their rarity, unusual appearance, and unique sound. We preserved the special tone of this diminutive instrument with stereo close and room mics.",
