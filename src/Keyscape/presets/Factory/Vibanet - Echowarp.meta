  "comment": "TIP - Try adjusting the Phaser and Echo settings under EFFECTS.\n\nHISTORY - We are pleased to present the official virtual instrument version of the Vintage Vibe Vibanet. When Stevie Wonder plays \"Superstition\" today, it's probably not on a Clavinet - it's most likely on one of these! Vintage Vibe started making their own electro-mechanical instruments in 2011 and released the Vibanet in 2014. This high-quality, modern take on a classic sounds just like the original, but with a lot more \"zing!\"\n\nLike the Clavinet, the Vibanet is an electro-mechanical keyboard, with two shock-resistant, single coil pickups which are positioned above and below the strings. Its keys cause polymer-tipped hammers to strike the electric-guitar-like strings, pushing them abruptly into contact with a metal \"anvil\" which serves as a fret. Releasing the keys takes the strings off the fret and the sound is damped. The internal pre-amp, which is also available as a replacement for original Clavinets, is extremely quiet.",
