  "comment": "TIP - Try adjusting the Mix and Reverb controls under MAIN.\n\nThis Duo is made from a combination of a rare, turn-of-the-20th-Century Wing Upright Tack piano and a 1960s-era Baldwin Electric Harpsichord. Lower registers are great for pensive moods and the mid-to-higher registers are great for evoking an old saloon vibe.",
