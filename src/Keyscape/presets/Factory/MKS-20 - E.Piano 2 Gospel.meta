  "comment": "TIP - Try different CHORUS settings.\n\nHISTORY - In the 1980s, after the DX-7 craze, keyboard players were still searching for the \"Holy Grail\" Rhodes sound in digital form. In 1986, Roland unveiled the 16-voice MKS-20, the best selling, rack-mounted version of their popular RD-1000. Both units used Roland's newly-developed \"Structured Adaptive Synthesis,\" an early type of re-synthesis that provided an extremely expressive response. \n\nEric Persing worked on developing the famous MKS-20 sounds in Japan with Roland in the 80s. Roland wisely combined the digital side of the instrument with high-quality analog components and effects, resulting in a far-warmer sound than most keyboards of that time. The unit went on to be used on thousands of well-known productions and remains an enduring classic.",
