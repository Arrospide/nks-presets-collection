  "comment": "TIP - Try different Distortion settings under EFFECTS.\n\nHISTORY - We are pleased to present the official virtual instrument version of the Vintage Vibe Tine Bass. The original Rhodes Piano Bass was produced from the early 1960s to 1975 and it was famously played by the Doors' keyboardist, Ray Manzarek, from its perch on top of his Vox Continental organ. Fast forward to 2011 when Vintage Vibe created the Tine Bass Piano - a high-quality, modern take on a classic.\n\nThe Vintage Vibe Tine Bass is an electro-mechanical tine piano that weighs 37 pounds (much less than its inspiration). The pickups are routed through VV's own tube pre-amp. A tine piano lets you play softly for a warm tone or hit the keys hard for a real growl. Played as a bass by itself, doubled with a classic organ sound or even a real bass, this instrument adds a nice, fat low end to your track.",
