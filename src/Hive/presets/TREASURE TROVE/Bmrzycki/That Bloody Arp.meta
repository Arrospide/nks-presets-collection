  "comment": "Lead sound from the virus arp hive demo. Made famous around 2006 on KVR as the arp sequence to compare super/hyper saw sounds across various synths.\nUsage:\nModwheel - put your hands in the air\r\nPressure - adds a bit of noise to the attack\r\nBreath - remove FX (reverb and delay)\r\n\r\nSet phaser Wet to 48 to for the phased section of the demo.\r\nEnable SUB2 on FILT2 for more bass."
